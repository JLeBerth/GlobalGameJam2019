    with you-'

  - 'Gunther: Creative.'
  - 'Sherry: Look who it is! Stet, how was the adventure? I see you made friends.'
  - 'Stetson: Don''t worry, Sherry, I won''t be here much longer. Just enough for
    Gunther here to fix De Confianza.'
  - 'Sherry: So a gunsmith! Good to see the economy of Neobode is booming!'
  - 'Gunther: Yep, gunsmith by trade. Stetson saved my life, least I can do is fix
    up his gun.'
  - 'Sherry: Ah, so you''re a hero, Stet?'
